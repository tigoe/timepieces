D6, 1N5817, Newark 48F6702
Digikey 1N5817DICT-ND, This keeps the 3.3V regulator from overheating. DO-41 package
IC1, MIC2915033-BU, Newark 83F5900, Make sure to use the the BU model  which is a surface-mount (TO-263) package. The two different packages help differentiate the 5V regulator from the 3.3V regulator.
ICSP, Pin Headers, Digikey 929974-01-08-ND, These are female headers  straight. I use male headers to hold them to the Arduino's female headers  with the male headers sandwiched in between the two boards.
J1, Pin Headers, Digikey 929974-01-08-ND, These are female headers  straight. I use male headers to hold them to the Arduino's female headers  with the male headers sandwiched in between the two boards.
J2, Pin Headers, Digikey 929974-01-0-ND, These are female headers  straight. I use male headers to hold them to the Arduino's female headers  with the male headers sandwiched in between the two boards.
J3, Pin Headers, Digikey 929974-01-08-ND, These are female headers  straight. I use male headers to hold them to the Arduino's female headers  with the male headers sandwiched in between the two boards.
